Project idea:
Create a multi-user TODO list organizer.

Key features:
* Support the notion of Projects->Tasks_Within_Each_Project
* Support infinite Notes on any Project or Task
* Support start/end datetimes for any Project or Task
* Be able to delete a Note/Task/Project and/or mark it as "Done" or
* "Irrelevant".
* Be able to set a priority on a Note/Task/Project.
* Accessible over HTTP(S) or SSH
* Well-defined backend storage format, so alternative implementations can be
* written
* Access control for Projects/Tasks.
* The Client shall cache key fingerprint on first connect and warn if it
* changes later
* (Todo later) Interrelated Projects/Tasks, with shared Tasks
* (Todo later) Give RO or RW access to Projects/Tasks to other users

Inspiration:
The few pieces of TODO list software in my package manager are pretty reasonable, but they only sync with Google Calendar. 
GCal's idea of a TODO list doesn't at all match what anyone would reasonably expect from a full-featured TODO list... 
so the TODO list software is pretty crippled by the impedance mismatch.
