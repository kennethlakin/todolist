How does Client expect Server behavior?

-Know when I delete a task, project (=Object)
-when added Object. 
-When Objects (or object data) changes. (e.g. When due dates change, when
	task is marked as done, etc)
-push data to all open clients when there's change or when client initially
	connects.
-know the latest state of the data and refuse modifications from clients without the 
	latest data. (i.e. Server will have version number of data). 
-acknowledge latest modifications and send version number. 




Structure of Object

Projects:
	start date - 1
	due date -1
	Name - 1
	priority - 1
	alarms/reminders- time with optional message. 0-N 
		absolute time alarms
		relative time alarms (eg relative to due date, or another alarm etc)
	child objects 0-N
		tasks, notes, other projects
Tasks:
	Identical to Projects except that notes are the only valid child objects
Notes:
	free form text
